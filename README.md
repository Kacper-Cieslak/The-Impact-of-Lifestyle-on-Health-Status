# The Impact of Lifestyle on Health-Status
### Abstract
This study examines the impact of lifestyle factors on self-assessed health status, using survey data from nearly 20 countries across Europe and Asia. An ordered logistic regression model was applied, with self-rated health as the dependent variable and lifestyle indicators (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity) as explanatory variables. The findings confirm the research hypothesis that lifestyle significantly influences health perception.

The results indicate that smoking and alcohol consumption negatively affect health: daily smoking and drinking reduce the likelihood of reporting "excellent" or "very good" health. In contrast, regular physical activity (at least 20 minutes daily) significantly increases the probability of positive health assessments while decreasing the odds of "fair" or "poor" ratings.

The study underscores that lifestyle modifications can enhance health outcomes, emphasizing the importance of public education on long-term health behaviors. A healthy population is crucial for economic development, and while changing habits is challenging, awareness of daily choices is key. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA.
